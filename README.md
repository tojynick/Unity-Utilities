## What is the purpose of the package? 🎯
I noticed that I reuse the same design patterns and components in many projects. But every time I need some utility (e.g. *singleton*) I have to reimport it from the other project, which is a pain in the ass 😖. So I wanted to create a package, that would contain many different tools I usually use.
**It is intended for personal use**, but I am open-sourcing it because probably someone else will find it helpful!

## What is inside? ℹ️
1. **Singleton 💎**
2. **Rotator 🌀** - rotates transform about given axis at a given rate.

## What will be added later? 🔮
* **Generic Pool 🪣**
